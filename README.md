# Jacks's Mathematical Center

This Project is a console project built using entirely C++ that contains a few different types of calculators. As of now, There is just a basic calculator (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division), and a Hypotnuse calculator that provides a step by step tutorial on how the problem was solved. I plan to add more types of calculators in the future.
